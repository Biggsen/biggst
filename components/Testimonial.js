He's an absolute pleasure to work with and immediately understands not only the requirements of the project but also of the business as a whole.<br/><br/>Whilst he has a brilliant grasp of the technologies involved in web development he also manages to apply them pragmatically rather than with rigid dogma."</blockquote>
